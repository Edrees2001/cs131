- Displays all column (feature) names with index numbers
- Prompts the user to input which columns are numerical
- Generates a `summary.md` file for each CSV that contains:
  - A numbered list of feature names
  - Min, Max, Mean, and StdDev for each selected numerical feature

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use This Script

1. **Make the script executable** (you only need to do this once):

   ```bash
   chmod +x datacollector.sh
